My New Helicopter
=================

Wow, I actually got the [eSky Belt CP CX](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCgH5-Kx6A) for my 30th birthday. Thank you Ingvild :-) Pics from the first outing found [here](../../Galleries/Helicopter outing/index.html).

As a pilot with only a few hours behind the controller, I think it generally flies very well. My only point of reference is my old Walkera Dragonfly 4, whose twitchy electronics and shoddy components generally failed when flying outdoors. This baby had no problems in light wind.

I have to admit though that I'm not entirely innocent in the case of the Walkera failing. It is my modifications to a more agile main rotor motor that may have caused the 4-in-1 mixer to fail. Or perhaps the step-up from 7.4V to 11.1V battery was the culprit. Who knows?

That chopper is now grounded, I'm not investing in a new 4-in-1.

I will post more flight experiences later.
