My Education
============

I graduated in 2009 at [University of Stavanger](http://www.uis.no) as a Master of Technology, Cybernetics and Signal Processing.

The bachelor degree gave me sound insight in digital control and communications. The subsequent master's degree was more focused on topics such as signal/image processing, optimization, numerical maths and advanced control theory. 

You can read more about some of the specific classes I took and browse the assignments I've handed in during the years.
